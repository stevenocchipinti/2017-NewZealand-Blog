Woke up early to be at the police station at 8:30am
Re sat the written test and passed!
The practical test gets you to go around cones, but they are quite close together which means you have to go quite slow and you're not allowed to put your feet on the ground. My first run I almost got through without using my feet, but the second last cone I did put my foot down, so he got me to do it again. I also put my foot down on the second run too, but it was before the slalom, which I ended up doing ok this time around. While technically he could have failed me, he gave me a pass mark.
In the end I paid $5x2 for the written test, $5 for the practical test and $20 for the licence.
From there I went to the avarua market

Got a marinated chicken plate that came with potato salad and veges with a home made passion fruit, mango, coconut and guava juice.

While I was eating I got chatting with an Aussie who works out in the mines and I'm pretty sure I saw the old guy from the tourism ad as well!
Spoke to a kite surfing company that has a stall at the market about lessons, sounds hard (normally around 15 hours to get good) but the intro course sounds easy enough as there is no board involve, just body dragging.
Went for a ride around the rest of the island, finally did a full lap! Really nice ride!
Stopped at muri beach along the way, barely any wind.

Decided with this weather it would be good to try a SUP (stand up paddleboard), so I rode to the hotel, got changed, grabbed a towel and went back to muri.
Hired the SUP from captain tava for $20 for an hour and gave it a go.
He said I wouldn't need lessons, just have to kneel with my knees on either side of the handle in the middle of the board. Start paddling out, then put one foot up until I feel comfortable, then stand up.
Kneeling was easy and pretty fun, putting one knee up wasn't too bad, just had to keep my body weight centered and evenly dispersed, but then standing was a little more challenging.
My legs were really shakey at first and I kept over compensating with my balance, but then after a little while you start to get the feel for it and the shaking slowed down.
About 10 minutes in I was doing ok upright, but a gust of wind would bring the shakes back.
By the end I did ok, I could stand-up even with some wind, but a strong head wind still made me shake a bit.
I alternated between standing and kneeling as I needed (standing to practice balance, kneeling for more speed and control) and I even laid down on my back for a while and stared up into the blue sky, very relaxing!
My hour was about up so I headed back to shore and dropped off the board and went for a walk down the beach.
Muri is a really nice beach, but the main reason I chose here instead of the beach near the hotel was because this beach has the largest lagoon and has a little bit of shelter from the wind. The beach at the hotel was much windier!
I eventually stopped along the beach and had a lay down in the shade, there were the traditional island drums playing in the background from a near by sandbar and I got taking to a nice girl from New Zealand named Kelly. Eventually some dark clouds started drifting in so we headed off.
By the time I got to my scooter it has started lightly raining, I was a bit hungry so I got a late lunch at the very popular Sails restaurant right on the beach.
After lunch I headed back to the hotel, had a shower and relaxed for a bit.
As it was getting later, I headed out to get some food, but I left it too late, so I just got some supplies from the nearby convenience store and went home.
