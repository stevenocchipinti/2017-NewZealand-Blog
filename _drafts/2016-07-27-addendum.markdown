Kia Orana == hello
Nu == coconut
The Black Pearl was nice accommodation, although Muri seems more central
Winter is pretty good here, rains a bit but normally not for too long
Chickens, dogs and geckos everywhere! But especially chickens!
Bus drivers are entertaining
Scooter licence requires some effort, written test requires local knowledge and practical test requires the ability to ride slowly around cones without your feet touching the ground
Scooting around the island is awesome
Water is still a bit cold this time if year, so requires some adjustment time, but it's not too bad
Groceries are expensive
Jet blast area is not like the ad
So many kiwis!
Lots of families and old people
5 digit phone numbers
BBQ meats with tomato or mushroom sauce, chop suey (noodles), rakau (Rarotongan spinach aka taro leaves, soaked in coconut cream), home made desserts, a variety of seafood including prawns, Marlin and Ika Mata (raw fish with coconut cream) and really nice bread are common foods
Local beer is Matutu, they have a pale ale and a lager
Weather report is generally not to be trusted and changes regularly, although windguru.co.nz did a pretty good job of predicting the wind a week ahead for kite surfing
Animals don't try to kill you here, most things are safe, including swimming in the lagoon, the sharks are on the other side of the reef!
Power points are the same as Australia
Uses New Zealand money, plus Cook Islands Triangle coins
